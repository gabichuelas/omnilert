# Omnilert Gif Search Engine Challenge

### [Leigh Larson](https://github.com/leighlars?tab=repositories)

#### Set up 
- Fork or clone repository into your local computer.  Since you don't want your project to be named "omnilert", add an optional argument after the repo url when cloning. The command should look like this: git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo].
- Once you have cloned the repo, change (`cd `) into the directory and run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
- Open your code into your text editor to view code. 
- Run `npm start` to launch and interact with site on `http://localhost:3000/`.
